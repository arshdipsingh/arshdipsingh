<h2 style="color: aliceblue; margin-left: 20px;">Who are minions?</h2>
 <p>Minions is a 2015 American 3D computer-animated comedy film,
 serving as a spin-off prequel to the Despicable Me franchise.<br> 
 Produced by Illumination Entertainment for Universal Pictures, 
 it was directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda, written by Brian Lynch, 
 and produced by Chris Meledandri and Janet Healy.<br>
 The film stars the voices of Coffin (as the Minions, including Kevin, Stuart, 
 and Bob), Sandra Bullock, Jon Hamm, Michael Keaton, Allison Janney, Steve Coogan, 
 and Jennifer Saunders, with narration by Geoffrey Rush.<br> It was first foreshadowed in 
 the end credits of Despicable Me 2 (2013), where Kevin, Stuart, and Bob, three of the Minions and the 
 film's main characters, are seen auditioning for the film.<p>
  <h2 style="color: aliceblue; margin-left: 20px;">From where they came?</h2>
  <p> Minions sheds some light on their beginnings in an opening credits sequence that depicts them evolving 
    in the ocean, similar to many other organisms, before emerging fully formed as they appear today (this is
     a departure from Darwin). Though the supervillain Gru has a gun that can transform humans into Minions, 
     it's only been seen in an amusement park ride, so most Minions presumably came from the sea. (If
      you're looking for more information about Minion reproduction, there's probably fan-fiction 
      somewhere that can help you out, but you'll have to Google it on your own.)</p>
      <h2 style="color: aliceblue; margin-left: 20px;">What language do minions speak?</h2>
      <p>Coffin has said the Minions speak a gibberish language that he spontaneously invents (albeit
         one that is infused with the occasional real word or phrase borrowed from a real language).
          In 2013, the Grammar Girl investigated some rumors about Minions linguistics and confirmed this claim.

        The Minions' native language is part of their unique appeal. Because the Minions already feel so ubiquitous
        
        , it's hard to remember just how audacious it is that one of the largest kids' movies of this summer is, for all intents and purposes, a foreign language film.</p>
